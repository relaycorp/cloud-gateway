# Terraform module for the Relaynet-Internet Gateway and its backing services

This directory contains all the Terraform resources to manage the cloud resources for each instance of the Relaynet-Internet Gateway operated by Relaycorp, and its respective backing services.

Every change to this directory or [`/tf-modules`](../tf-modules) in the `main` branch is automatically pushed to Terraform Cloud, where it's reviewed one last time and then applied (or rejected).
